    <h1>Navigating Familiy Law in Kitsap County<br>without an Attorney</h1>
    <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
        Going to court, filing legal paperwork are already daunting enough tasks without
        the stress that usually precedes and persists going through this process. <br>
        I am not an Attorney nor a Paralegal, this information is just presented as is from
        personal experience and research I've done to try and navigate this process. <br>
        Please do not take anything from this page as legal advice.<br><br>
        There are a number of free resources out there that can be used to prepare legal documents.
        I have links on the <a href="links.html">Resources</a>page as well as an explaination of what 
        each site brings to the table. There is some ridiculous legal speak out there which seems like
        it is there just to confuse you. I've tried to unpack some of this in the <a href="jargon.html">Jargon</a> page.
