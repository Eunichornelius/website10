    There are a number of great resources out here for us here in Washington State. Probably one of the best resources
    is
    <a href="https://www.washingtonlawhelp.org/" target="_blank">WA Law Help</a> their page on <a
      href="https://www.washingtonlawhelp.org/issues/family-law" target="_blank">Family Law</a> is particularly useful.
    For the most up to date forms the best place is of course the source:<a
      href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/?fa=forms.contribute&formID=13" target="_blank">Courts.wa.gov/forms</a> all
    of the up to
    date
    forms are here for download in both Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF forms.<br>

    The first piece of advice that I have when it comes to court is this: be the person that files first. Even if you
    are not the person who is primarily pushing for dissolution of a marriage or relationship, File first. You are at
    a serious disadvantage if the other party files before you do. What next? at a minimum 2 forms. <br>
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20Divorce%20200%20Summons%202022%2001%20(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">FL Divorce
      200</a>
    which is a formal summons about any of 5 actions to break a partnership or marriage. This gives the other party 20
    days from the date
    paperwork is served to them to respond in writing. 60 days if out of state. BOTH to the person who started this
    action "Petitioner" and file with the court.
    and <a
      href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20Divorce%20201%20Petition%20for%20Divorce_2023%2001%20(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">
      FL divorce 201</a>
    which is the "meat and potatoes" of the information about the terms of the end of your marriage or domestic
    partnership. <br>
    For ease of serving paperwork, I recommend also filing <a
      href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/All%20Civil%20006%20Agreement%20re%20Service%20by%20Email.pdf"
      target="_blank">All
      Civil 006</a>
    which is an Email Service Agreement. <br>
    <img src="img/cattorney2.png">
  </article>
  <article>
    There are a lot of other things that need to be filed with the court in combination with Divorce 201.<br>
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20All%20Family%20135%20Declaration%20-%20blank%202016_05(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">
      FL 135 Declaration</a> which is for general statements made that are relavent to the case.
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20All%20Family%20131%20Financial%20Declaration_2016%2009%2026(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">
      FL All Family 131</a> which is a financial declaration. It is probably a good idea to also use
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20All%20Family%20011%20Sealed%20Financial%20Source%20Docs%202016_05(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">
      FL011 Sealed Financial Documents</a> cover sheet to protect your personal financial information. <br>
    Everything filed without a cover sheet is a public record that can be requested by anyone. PROTECT YOUR
    PRIVACY!<br>
    Other cover sheets that maybe useful are:
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20All%20Family%20013%20Sealed%20Confid%20Report.pdf"
      target="_blank">
      FL013 Sealed Confidential Report</a> and

    The most difficult part of divorce or ending a domestic partnership is when there are children involved. There are
    a number of
    different things that need to be filed. The first and most important is
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20All%20Family%20140%20Parenting%20Plan_06_2024(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">FL140
      a parenting plan</a> this can be modified at a later date with <a
      href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20Modify%20601%20Pt%20to%20Change%20Parenting%20Plan%20Custody%20Or_2022%2007%20(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">
      FL Modify 601</a>. If the divorce is finalized, you also need to file <a
      href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20Modify%20600%20Summons%20to%20Change%20Parenting%20Plan_%202022%2001%20(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">FL600.</a>
    Along with the financial declaration, a <a
      href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/WSCSS_Worksheets2019%2001(02).pdf" target="_blank">
      child support worksheet</a>
    needs to be filled out and submitted. This is why it is important to submit as much financial documentation as
    possible. not just for the division of assets, but to ensure that there is substantiating evidence of what portion
    is to be paid in case of
    any dispute that may arise. It is important to note that this ammount can be adjusted via
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20Modify%20501%20Pt%20to%20Modify%20Child%20Support_2022%2001%20(2).pdf"
      target="_blank">Form
      FL501.</a>
    This needs to be filed with
    <a href="https://www.courts.wa.gov/forms/documents/FL%20Modify%20500%20Smn%20to%20Mod%20Child%20Support_%202022%2001%20(2).pdf"
